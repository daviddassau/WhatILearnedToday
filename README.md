# What I Learned Today

I'm a big believer in lifelong learning. We as humans really do learn something new every day, whether we realize it or not. This is a log of at least 1 new thing I learned, per day, starting with May 27th, 2019.

### 5/28/2019
Today, I learned that the latest release of Angular (which is 8) is now available. So now I feel like I've been living under a rock...

### 5/27/2019
Today, I learned that TFS (Team Foundation Server), a popular Microsoft-owned source/version control system, is now known as Azure DevOps Services (the Cloud version) and Azure DevOps Server (the On-Premises version).
