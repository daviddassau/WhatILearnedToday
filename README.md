# What I Learned Today

I'm a big believer in lifelong learning. We as humans really do learn something new every day, whether we realize it or not. This is a log of at least 1 new thing I learned, per day, starting with May 27th, 2019.

### 6/14/2019
I apologize, it's been too long since my last "post". I've been incredibly busy with job hunting/interviewing, but let me tell you, I have definitely learned a LOT. The most important lesson I learned, however, was an iteration of that old proverb "Don't count your chickens before they hatch". Either that one, or "Don't put all your eggs in one basket". Don't ask me why both proverbs that are applicable to my current situation both have to do with chickens lol. Anyways, there was a job prospect that I put too much stock into, and ended up not panning out. I thought it was a done deal, so I began turning my head up at potential job interviews. I know, I know, shame on me, I should have known better, blah blah blah. But you know what? Lesson learned. And for me, the lessons that I learn the HARD way are the ones that usually end up sticking the best. I continue to remain positive with my job search. I have a few prospects and leads, so I'm hoping that something pans out soon!

### 6/5/2019
Today, I learned that......I HAVE A FINAL INTERVIEW TOMORROW! I am so friggin' pumped, you don't even know. So yeah, my final face-to-face with SmileDirectClub in downtown Nashville will be tomorrow, May the 5th. And since it's on a Thursday, I'm hoping that will give them some time to deliberate and make me an offer by the end of day that Friday. CHEERS!

### 6/4/2019
Today, I learned that the bus routes going from Murfreesboro to downtown Nashville are WAY too long. There's no reason why it should take 2-2.5 hours by bus to travel that far via public transit!

### 6/3/2019
Today, I learned that I am getting super burned out on job hunting, interviewing, talking about myself, etc. Thank god it looks like I am closing in on a job at SmileDirectClub

### 5/30/2019
Today, I learned that it's absolutely nerve-racking to sit and wait for a very important interview to begin. Ok, so maybe this isn't something _new_ per se, but it is something that I had kind of forgotten about, regarding the interview process.

### 5/29/2019
Today, I learned that I still possess the ability to impress myself. I managed to secure not 1, but 2, round-three interviews! First one is for a dev position at National General Insurance, tomorrow at 2pm. The second one will (most likely) be with SmileDirectClub, probably either this Friday, or Monday of next week!

### 5/28/2019
Today, I learned that the latest release of Angular (which is 8) is now available. So now I feel like I've been living under a rock...

### 5/27/2019
Today, I learned that TFS (Team Foundation Server), a popular Microsoft-owned source/version control system, is now known as Azure DevOps Services (the Cloud version) and Azure DevOps Server (the On-Premises version).
