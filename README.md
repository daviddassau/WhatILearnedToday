# What I Learned Today

I'm a big believer in lifelong learning. We as humans really do learn something new every day, whether we realize it or not. This is a log of at least 1 new thing I learned, per day, starting with May 27th, 2019.

### 6/5/2019
Today, I learned that......I HAVE A FINAL INTERVIEW TOMORROW! 

### 6/4/2019
Today, I learned that the bus routes going from Murfreesboro to downtown Nashville are WAY too long. There's no reason why it should take 2-2.5 hours by bus to travel that far via public transit!

### 6/3/2019
Today, I learned that I am getting super burned out on job hunting, interviewing, talking about myself, etc. Thank god it looks like I am closing in on a job at SmileDirectClub

### 5/30/2019
Today, I learned that it's absolutely nerve-racking to sit and wait for a very important interview to begin. Ok, so maybe this isn't something _new_ per se, but it is something that I had kind of forgotten about, regarding the interview process.

### 5/29/2019
Today, I learned that I still possess the ability to impress myself. I managed to secure not 1, but 2, round-three interviews! First one is for a dev position at National General Insurance, tomorrow at 2pm. The second one will (most likely) be with SmileDirectClub, probably either this Friday, or Monday of next week!

### 5/28/2019
Today, I learned that the latest release of Angular (which is 8) is now available. So now I feel like I've been living under a rock...

### 5/27/2019
Today, I learned that TFS (Team Foundation Server), a popular Microsoft-owned source/version control system, is now known as Azure DevOps Services (the Cloud version) and Azure DevOps Server (the On-Premises version).
